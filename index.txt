Dear %%first_name%%,

We are excited to see you at TEPSA and hear about your plans for the 2019–2020 school year. Stop by Booth 222 to visit with us and explore the new Voyager Passport®, our proven, evidence-based reading intervention that accelerates achievement by targeting the priority skills and strategies K–5 students need to be fluent, on-level readers.

We also will be offering demonstrations of LETRS® (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling), our professional development course of study that helps teachers learn the science of reading and gives them the tools to teach language and literacy skills to every student.
